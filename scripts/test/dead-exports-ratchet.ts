/**
 * A value exported from src/db/queries/, src/config/ or src/lib/ that NOTHING
 * references.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Dead exports here are not clutter, they are misinformation. Three shipped
 * examples, all found by hand:
 *
 *   markAgentMessageRead  — the ONLY writer of `read: true`, never called, so
 *                           the Control escalation banner could never be
 *                           cleared and was permanent by construction (#507).
 *   closeStaleAgentTurns  — never scheduled, while its own docblock promises
 *                           the table "does not accumulate rows that look open
 *                           forever". The comment asserts a guarantee nothing
 *                           provides.
 *   EXECUTOR_COPY.loki.*  — eight unread keys inside a file headed "SSOT for
 *                           user-facing execution copy". Editing them changes
 *                           nothing on screen.
 *
 * A config value read in zero places, or a query with no caller, reads to the
 * next person as a working part of the system. That is worse than absence.
 *
 * A RATCHET, NOT A PURGE. The current set is recorded in BASELINE below. New
 * dead exports fail; the existing ones are visible and can be worked down.
 * Removing one and forgetting the list is also caught: a BASELINE entry that is
 * no longer dead fails too, so the list cannot rot into a lie.
 *
 * SCOPE. These three directories only, deliberately. They are the places where
 * a name is almost always referenced statically, so "no references" really does
 * mean dead. Route handlers are excluded because they are addressed by URL —
 * an earlier scan of mine called nine /api/crons/* routes dead when systemd
 * timers on the box invoke them, which a repo-wide grep cannot see. Components
 * are excluded because a sweep already proved none are unrendered.
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT A REPORT. docs/AUDIT_REPORT_2026-07-13.md names four dead
 * exports. Two months later three of the four were still there, and one of them
 * (renderPromptBody) is in this file's BASELINE — a report is read once, a gate
 * is read on every push.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/dead-exports-ratchet.ts
