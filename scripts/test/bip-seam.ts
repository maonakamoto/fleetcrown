/**
 * The Thoughts ↔ bip-kit seam.
 *
 * FleetCrown's essay parser now lives in the published `bip-kit` package (this
 * repo is its flagship dependent). These tests pin the seam: the re-exports
 * delegate for real, and every committed essay still parses into blocks the
 * renderer has cases for — so a bip-kit upgrade that changed block semantics
 * would fail here, not on the live site.
