 * CLAIM approved-but-unexecuted actions of a type, oldest first.
 *
 * The local runtime's calendar drain calls this (type=create_event) to find
 * events approved on the cloud control plane — where `gog` isn't present — so
 * it can book them locally.
 *
 * This must be a claim, not a read. `markActionExecuted` only fires AFTER the
 * booking succeeds, so between handing a row out and hearing back there is a
 * window in which the row still looks approved-and-unbooked to everybody. A
 * plain SELECT hands the same event to every caller in that window, and each
 * one books it — a duplicate entry in the operator's real calendar. One drain
 * runs today, but home/calendar-drain.ts's own usage line tells you to start
 * another, so the seam has to be safe for N of them by construction.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, doing different jobs:
 *   - FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED makes CONCURRENT claims disjoint. Two drains
 *     asking at the same instant get different rows instead of blocking or
 *     colliding.
 *   - `leaseMinutes` handles the drain that takes a row and then DIES. Its
 *     claim ages out and the row is offered again, so a crash costs a delay
 *     rather than an event that is never booked. Too short re-books a slow
 *     `gog` call; too long strands the work. Minutes, not seconds.
 *
 * `batchLimit` exists so a claim cannot outlive its own lease. The drain books
 * the batch one at a time, so claiming more rows than fit in `leaseMinutes`
 * would let the tail of the batch go stale while the drain is still working on
 * it — and a second drain would then legitimately claim rows the first is about
 * to book. Keep batchLimit × (booking time) comfortably under the lease.
 *
 * Idempotency still rests on markActionExecuted's status='approved' guard —
 * the claim narrows the race, it does not replace the guard.
