// Cron target — stale orchestration-run reaper.
//
// cleanupStaleOrchestrationRuns previously ran ONLY when someone loaded
// /api/control, so a dead run stayed "waiting" until the next human page
// view — in the 2026-07-02 dead-fleet incident, 16 runs lingered open for
// 51 hours and the outcome streak / autonomy stats saw nothing. A janitor
// that guards the truthfulness of run state cannot depend on a human
// happening to look; it runs on the clock.
//
// Schedule: hourly at :15 (systemd timer, scripts/install-hetzner-crons.sh),
// matching STALE_RUN_MINUTES=60 so a dead run is stamped within ~75 minutes.
