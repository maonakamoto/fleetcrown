/**
 * Terminal multiplexer adapter registry.
 *
 * Adding a new multiplexer (tmux, screen, browser-shell, kitty-tabs):
 *   1. Write `./tmux.ts` exporting `tmuxAdapter: TerminalAdapter`.
 *   2. Add it to `ALL_TERMINALS` below.
 * Same pattern as src/lib/agents — every consumer that needs to inject /
 * focus / dump-screen reads through this index, not through any specific
 * adapter file.
 *
 * Today Zellij is the only impl, so the resolver functions degenerate
 * to "return zellijAdapter". When a second impl lands, those functions
 * become real choice logic (detect installed, prefer user's configured
 * default, fall back to first available).
