// Single source of truth for the product brand on the TypeScript side.
// scripts/_brand.sh mirrors APP_NAME / APP_SLUG / APP_DOMAIN for shell.
// To rebrand the entire product, edit this file + scripts/_brand.sh + the
// Caddy host config on the box + DNS at the registrar — that's it.
//
// Conventions:
//   APP_NAME     Display string. Appears in <title>, sidebar, marketing.
//   APP_SLUG     Lowercase kebab. Used in URLs, file paths, env-var prefixes.
//   APP_DOMAIN   Canonical hostname (no scheme). Used in callbacks, emails, copy.
//
// Visual identity: The primary mark is the spiral SVG defined in
// BrandMark.tsx (alternating semicircular arcs of growing radius, two-layer
// fade). icon.svg + all opengraph-*.tsx MUST stay pixel-identical (see
// comments in those files). Never introduce a second mark. Public surfaces
// always dark; ui-public-* / ui-auth-* intentionally use white/opacity inside
// globals.css only.
//
// Name evaluation criteria (from first principles + product positioning):
// - Must preserve "fleet" language in copy (run your fleet, fleet scale,
//   fleet command, Fleet Runner, robotic fleets, orchestration).
// - Must evoke active human command / control plane / direction / judgment
//   (not passive ride/surf, not just "the tool for X").
// - Tone: serious infrastructure for power users & future robotics, not toy or
//   meme. "Serious operators", "no compromises", "durable OS".
// - Scalable to non-AI (robots, physical fleets) without sounding silly.
// - Ownable: clean .com/.app, socials, no major TM conflicts (esp. avoid Disney
//   "Muppet", heavy existing industrial "Crown fleet", etc.).
// - Short, memorable slug; works as wordmark + icon; easy to say/spell.
// - Supports hybrid (local Runner + remote command) story.
// See docs/branding-design.md for the full rationale, name selection criteria,
// visual identity rules, and why FleetCrown was selected/stuck with over
// alternatives (including recent .com-available "shade/shady fleet" proposals
// like shadefleet.com / shadyfleet.com, and especially fleetclown.com — the
// latter rejected as the worst possible inversion of "crown"/command/serious
// infrastructure tone).
