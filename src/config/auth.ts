// ─── Public marketing nav — platform-wide content only.
//
// A deliberate architectural boundary lives here: every entry must apply to
// the whole platform, not to a single user. Per-user surfaces (the user's
// own Thoughts, profile, etc.) live in the in-app sidebar and on user
// profile routes (/u/<username>/...), never in the public marketing nav —
// even when the founder's own essays happen to discuss the platform.
//
// Three shapes:
//   - "menu" → dropdown with items + descriptions (mega-menu)
//   - "link" → single direct link in the top nav
//   - "external" → link to another origin (sibling product, etc.)
//                  Rendered with an explicit external-target indicator so
//                  visitors know they are leaving fleetcrown.orangecat.ch.
// The shape is per-entry so we never paint a one-item dropdown.
